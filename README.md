This is a site to experiment and learn Vue features. So far this is a simple todo app that shows state variables, components, passing props, emitting events, also with animation, uses pico.css which is a nice light framework for small projects.

I created this site with this video, 40min, worth watching: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oKpoqmUj64
